# Understanding

## How to know if we understand?

- Feynman Technique:To understand something, you have to be able to explain it in a way that makes sense to your friend, its essentially understanding the big picture
- Once you‚Äôve learned a topic (or at every junction within the topic), ask yourself:
    1. Does this make sense?
    2. Could I explain it to a 5-year old/friend?
- Background
    - Keep the language simple
    - Don‚Äôt focus so much on the details of the topic that you can‚Äôt get the big picture
    - Summarize the answer to the question as simply as possible and in as few words as possible

## Active Recall

- Testing Yourself (learning something in the first place)
- Test yourself more often; testing is essential for understanding and learning something.
- To strengthen the neural connection in our brains, you have to retrieve the information by taking the information out of our brains
- Test yourself more > reading and highlighting
- Testing yourself is a fundamental process of learning
- Use active recall as you read (After reading every paragraph, close the book and ask yourself: What have I just read? Key concepts of what I‚Äôve just read? Can I rephrase this in my own words?) (Once you answer those questions go back & check, which helps with forgetting curve and strengthens the connection between our brain neurons)
- Quiz yourself on the material as you go along- Stop re-reading, trust the process, and tell yourself a story of the content as you‚Äôre going through it

## Taking Notes During Class

- FUNDAMENTAL IDEA: The harder our brain has to work to do something, the more likely we are to remember the thing
- Handwriting notes better than typing notes > helps think more intensely.

- Methods of note taking:
    - print power point PDF and annotate during lecture
    - write things out on pen and paper and then scan them
    - Cornell note taking system: on one side of the paper have notes from the class, and then on the other side write questions for yourself that correspond to the answer taken on notes. As you are studying your notes, instead of passively re-reading and highlighting our notes, cover up notes and ask questions (forces yourself to use active recall). Can use app 'notion' to accompany this technique.
    - use mind map > topic in middle and things going off other side

## Taking Notes After Class

- Main reason to take notes after class:
    
    a. Build active recall questions
    
    b. Consolidate understanding of the subject
    

1. Be able to use multiple/different sources to build up picture and understand it > can be tricky to understand things in class as you go. Therefore, helps to look over notes and add more little bits.

2. Can use the Cornell note taking system to write questions for ourselves

## Scoping the Subject

- To understand something, we need to know where it fits on the broader picture.
- You need to sub-categorize what you are learning on the subject.
- Before you learn something new, you need to create a ‚Äútree‚Äù where all the branches are connected to the tree, and the leaves are connected to the branches. A bird‚Äôs eye view of the overall concept helps you apply these concepts in real life. ‚ÄúStarting off with the broader picture and then narrowing it down‚Äù is far better and more efficient in understanding what we are learning

# Remembering

## Spaced Repetition

- **spaced repetition involves spacing your revision and reviewing topics, ideally by active recall, at specific intervals over a period of time**
- Sessions: Today, Tomorrow, Three days later, One week later, and One month later
- Your brain needs to forget about half of the information so that when you review the information again, your brain has to work hard to remember that information. Contracting and relaxing your brain, like a muscle, strengthens the connection in a very efficient way.

## Retrospective Revision Time table

- It's a way of implementing spaced repetition to our study
- We decide on the day, what topic we review on the past, and how effective our recall on that topic was
- So after we study a topic for the first day we will color code it
    - Red üü• - Hard
    - Orange üüß - Medium
    - Green üü© - Easy
- On the first day we need to write our selves some active recall questions and notes

## ****The Power of Interleaved Practice****

- Interleaving involves how you split up your time within one study session itself. It is the idea that we should mix up our practice as we go along within the same study session.
- **when you are learning two or more related concepts or skills, instead of focusing exclusively on one concept or skill at a time, it can be helpful to alternate between them**

## ****Should You Re-Read Your Notes****

- re-reading is considered low utility, self testing is the best option with active recall, space recall and utilizing Interleaved ********Practice study session of active recall.
- Re-reading is sort of useful. It's useful to have as the equivalent of going to the gym, doing a single pull-up and then just going on your phone for the rest of the time.

## ****How to Highlight Effectively****

- Highlighting is NOT very effective.
- Highlight notes
    - Yellow: general stuff
    - Blue: something particularly insightful or interesting
    - Pink: good for flashcards
    - Purple: experimental evidence worth remembering

## ****How to Use Flashcards Properly****

- Flash Cards: Marriage between Active Recall & Space Repetition.
- Anki allows you to download a pre-made deck of cards - better to make your own if you study a lesser syllabus
- Only use for stuff that is hard to study or remember
    - Ask yourself "Do i really need a flashcard for this‚Äù

## ****Mind Maps****

- Mind maps help to develop a broad understanding, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the topic

## ****Memory Techniques - Mnemonics****

- A mnemonic device, or memory device, is any learning technique that aids information retention or retrieval in the human memory for better understanding.¬†[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic)
- something such as a very short poem or a special word used to help a person remember something

![mnemonic.jpg](How%20to%20Study%20for%20Exams%206f00bcbe3c984e1f8ca23353428596e4/mnemonic.jpg)

## ****Memory Techniques - The Peg System****

- The mnemonic peg system, invented by Henry Herdson is a memory aid that works by creating mental associations between two concrete objects in a one-to-one fashion that will later be applied to to-be-remembered information

## ****Memory Techniques - The Mind Palace****

- The method of loci is a strategy for memory enhancement, which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information. The method of loci is also known as the memory journey, memory palace, or mind palace technique
- Mental Projections are crucial for developing your Mind Palace. It allows you to cleverly allocate your memories based on key locations.

## ****The Essay Memorization Framework****

- Two Stages to the method:
    
    1. Creation stage - create first class essay plans to every conceivable exam question that could be given
    
    2. Memorization - committing these essay plans to memory using high-utility memory techniques
    
    1. Anki Flashcards for Content Blocks.
    
    2. Spider Diagrams for entire essays.
    
    3. Retrospective Revision for Spaced Repetition and Active Recoil.
    

## ****The Active Recall Framework****

- writing questions forces you to really focus and try to commit to memory the answer so that when it is time to go over the questions, you are not clueless about the answers. it also automatically gets you into active recall mode. plus, it is more fun and engaging. you can ask all sorts of questions. you can get playful with your questions. it is more engaging to write questions and later try to answer them in both the writing and answering phase. especially when you don't have the answers tucked somewhere so that you can look them up, you mind is forced to work even harder, which will result in deeper, more engaging, more meaningful learning.

# Focusing

## ****Motivation Is a Myth****

- Gold standard approach: scrub the word motivation from our vocabulary and replace the concept of motivation with the concept of discipline.
- Replace the word ‚Äúhave to‚Äù with ‚Äúget to‚Äù
- It doesn't matter how you feel but it depends on what needs to be done, its ***discipline***

## ****How to Reduce Distractions****

- If you can enjoy or fully focus on your subject, you are less likely to be distracted
- Increase the amount of friction it takes to do bad things on your phone
    - bury your social apps in folders
    - this gives your mind time to reverse the decision
    - Look into apps and Chrome extensions that block apps

## ****The Best Music to Study With****

- Music With Lyrics - Bad
- Music without Lyrics - OK but not best
- Silent - Best and optimal
- And try and mimic or try and recreate the environment that you will write your exam in
